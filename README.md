## Here's an example program in Perl that calculates a person's age and the number of days until their next birthday:

## This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a IDE or code editor environment and follow the prompts.

# Version: 1.0.1
## Optimized version of the program:
## This version:
## 1. Uses the Time::Piece module instead of regular expressions to manipulate dates
## 2. Avoids repeated calculations by storing the result of localtime in a variable
## 3. Eliminates unnecessary variable assignments
## Uses printf instead of string concatenation for better performance and readability
## Note! that some of these optimizations may come at the cost of readability, so it's important to strike a balance between performance and maintainability.
